# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-07
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 14

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a personal 10-weekend AI Resolution tracker from empty repo to production Vercel deployment. The journey follows a strict dependency chain: database and design system first (everything depends on persisted data), read path second (display before interaction), write path third (the core CRUD loop), scorecard fourth (unique UI patterns that should not block basic tracking), suggestion engine and animations fifth (require completion data), and visualization plus production hardening last (require scored weekends and all features working). Six phases, each delivering a coherent, verifiable capability.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Data Layer
**Goal**: A deployed Next.js app with a populated Neon Postgres database, established design system, and server-first architecture pattern ready for feature development
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md -- Project scaffolding, Drizzle + Neon setup, database schema, push to Neon
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md -- Seed script with all 11 weekends of actual PDF content
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md -- Apple-inspired design system, landing page, Vercel deployment

### Phase 2: Weekend Overview
**Goal**: Users can browse all 10 weekends, see their current progress, and drill into full weekend details -- the complete read path
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md -- Query layer, overview page with category-grouped grid, progress bar, weekend cards, skeleton loading
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md -- Weekend detail page with full info display, back navigation, 404 handling, skeleton loading

### Phase 3: Core Interactions
**Goal**: Users can track their progress by checking off work items and capturing reflections -- the core CRUD loop that makes the app useful
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md -- Install dependencies, Server Actions (toggleWorkItem, saveNotes), debounce hook
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md -- Interactive checkboxes (optimistic UI), notes editor (auto-save + markdown preview), update detail page

### Phase 4: Weekly Scorecard
**Goal**: Users can rate completed weekends on four dimensions to build a personal evaluation record
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md -- Schema changes, Server Actions (saveRating, saveScorecardNotes), query update, shadcn/ui components
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md -- Scorecard UI components, conditional rendering in WeekendDetail

### Phase 5: Suggestion Engine & Polish
**Goal**: Users get intelligent next-weekend recommendations and the app feels polished with purposeful animations
**Depends on**: Phase 3 (needs completion data)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md -- Suggestion engine pure function and "Up Next" banner on overview page
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md -- Install motion + canvas-confetti, celebration confetti on weekend completion
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md -- Motion animations (progress bar spring, staggered cards, page enter transitions)

### Phase 6: Visualization & Production Hardening
**Goal**: Users can see score trends across completed weekends, and the app is production-ready with proper error handling and performance
**Depends on**: Phase 4 (needs scorecard data), Phase 5
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md -- Score trends visualization (aggregation query, grouped bar chart, lazy-loaded on overview page)
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md -- Production hardening (error boundaries, 404 page, global error handler, build verification)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Server-first architecture (Server Components + Server Actions)
- Neon Postgres + Drizzle ORM for serverless performance
- shadcn/ui Nova style with Zinc base for Apple-minimalist aesthetic
- Motion library for animations, canvas-confetti for celebrations
- Recharts via shadcn/ui chart for score visualization

**Issues Resolved:**
- Next.js 16 Turbopack disallows ssr:false in Server Components -- used Client Component wrapper
- Page exit animations broken in App Router -- used enter-only via template.tsx
- Identity sequence bug after seeding -- reset with setval()

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- drizzle-kit push used instead of migrations (acceptable for single-user dev)
- No auth (accepted risk for personal non-sensitive data)
